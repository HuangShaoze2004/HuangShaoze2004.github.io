####  国家级大学生创新训练项目：柔性液态镓纳米结构的设计构建和动态光谱调制

<div style="text-align: justify;">
As the project leader, I aim to fabricate large-area uniform stretchable liquid 
gallium multilayer films, dynamically regulate the thickness of each layer through 
stretching to achieve dynamic spectral control from deep ultraviolet to infrared, and 
develop multi-band fluorescence enhancement technology based on thickness-dependent plasmon 
resonance effects, providing a novel optical platform for wide-spectrum biochemical detection. 
So far, one SCI paper has been published based on this project.

#### Self-Study of Deep Learning in the Field of Computer Science

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I started self-studying deep learning during the winter vacation in 
January 2025. I focused on the YOLO algorithm in the field of computer 
vision, made improvements to it, and applied it in the field of materials. 
I have already published one SCI paper (as the first and corresponding author).
After completing the writing of the first paper, I guided my computer 
science major classmates in improving the YOLO algorithm. We have now 
published one SCI paper (as the second author).
