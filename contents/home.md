<div style="text-align: justify;">

My name is Huang Shaoze, and I am a junior undergraduate student at Anhui University of Technology, majoring in Materials Science and Engineering. After three years of study, I have a solid foundation in my major and successfully passed the CET-6 in my sophomore year. In addition to my coursework, I have a strong ability to learn independently. I have taught myself programming languages such as C++, Python, and Matlab, and I am proficient in various graphing software.

Building on these skills, I have participated in numerous academic competitions and achieved good results in mathematical modeling and innovation and entrepreneurship contests, earning over ten awards at the university level and above.

In terms of research, I have led a national-level undergraduate innovation project and co-authored an SCI paper as the second author. Moreover, I have independently studied deep learning in the field of computer science, improved the YOLO algorithm for object detection, and applied it to the field of materials science, resulting in two additional SCI papers.

My greatest strength is my strong ability to learn independently and my willingness to delve into problems. I understand the difference between research and academia, but I am determined to continue pursuing a career in research and plan to pursue a Ph.D. in the future.
